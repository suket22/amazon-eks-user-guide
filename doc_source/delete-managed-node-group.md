# Deleting a managed node group<a name="delete-managed-node-group"></a>

This topic describes how you can delete an Amazon EKS managed node group\.

When you delete a managed node group, Amazon EKS will first set the minimum, maximum and desired size of your Auto Scaling group to 0, which will trigger a scale down of your node group. Before each instance is terminated, Amazon EKS will first send a signal to drain the pods from that node and wait 5 minutes. If the pods haven't drained after 5 minutes, Amazon EKS will let Auto Scaling continue the termination of the instance. Once all instances are terminated, the Auto Scaling group is deleted. 


**Important**  
If you delete a managed node group that uses a node IAM role that isn't used by any other managed node group in the cluster, the role is removed from the [`aws-auth` ConfigMap](add-user-role.md)\. If any self\-managed node groups in the cluster are using the same node IAM role, the self\-managed nodes move to the `NotReady` status, and the cluster operation are also disrupted\. You can add the mapping back to the ConfigMap to minimize disruption\.

**To delete a managed node group**

1. Open the Amazon EKS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/eks/home\#/clusters](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters)\.

1. Choose the cluster that contains the node group to delete\.

1. Select the **Configuration** tab\. On the **Compute** tab, select the node group to delete, and choose **Delete**\.

1. On the **Delete Node group: <node group name>** page, type the name of the node group in the text field and choose **Delete**\.
